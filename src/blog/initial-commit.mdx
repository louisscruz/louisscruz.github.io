Beginnings are my favorite.

They're opportunities to make bold statements, challenge expectations, and expose ideas that are at some point revealed to work against themselves in some manner.

However, endings that come to a conclusion in some meaningful way offer the most satisfaction.

The longer something goes on and on, the more complex it becomes.

Things that occur later have to reconcile themselves against prior established facts and the patterns of precedent.

What lies here is a collection of writings that is primarily technically, though, hopefully, some more profound purpose will emerge.
